## What You'll Create

1. **A Drive folder** where all artwork is stored
2. **A Google Sheet** that tracks everything (your "database")
3. **A web app URL** that students visit to use the gallery

## If You Get Stuck

- Each step has a "Something Wrong?" section
- The [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) covers common issues
- You can always delete and start over - nothing is permanent until students upload work

## Get a Helper (Optional)

If you're not confident with Google tools, ask:

- A tech-savvy parent volunteer
- Your school's IT person (they don't need to do much)
- Another teacher who's comfortable with spreadsheets

They can follow along with you or do the technical parts while you handle the teaching side.
