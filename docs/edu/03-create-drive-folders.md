# Create Your Drive Folders

This folder will store all student artwork. Takes about 10 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Create the Main Folder

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Click **+ New** → **New folder**
3. Name it: `Art Gallery`
4. Press **Create**

---

## Step 2: Create Subfolders

Inside your new `Art Gallery` folder, create two subfolders:

1. Open the `Art Gallery` folder
2. Click **+ New** → **New folder**
3. Create these two folders:
   - `classes`
   - `featured`

Your structure should look like this:

```
Art Gallery/
  ├── classes/
  └── featured/
```

---

## Step 3: Share with Your School

1. Right-click the `Art Gallery` folder
2. Click **Share** → **Share**
3. Under "General access," click the dropdown
4. Select **Anyone at [Your School] with the link**
5. Make sure it says **Viewer** (not Editor)
6. Click **Done**

> **Why Viewer?** Students will upload through the web app, not directly to Drive. This keeps things organized.

## Step 4: Save the Folder ID

You'll need this later when setting up the web app.

1. Open the `Art Gallery` folder
2. Look at the URL in your browser. It looks like:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC123xyz...
   ```
3. Copy the long string after `/folders/` (that's your Folder ID)
4. Save it somewhere - you'll need it in Step 5

## Checkpoint

You should now have:

- [x] An `Art Gallery` folder in your Drive
- [x] Two subfolders: `classes` and `featured`
- [x] Folder shared with your school domain
- [x] The Folder ID copied and saved

---

## Something Wrong?

**"I don't see the sharing options"**
Your school may restrict sharing. Ask IT to enable "sharing within domain" for your account.

**"I can't find the folder ID"**
Make sure you're inside the `Art Gallery` folder, not just looking at it in a list. The URL only shows the ID when you're inside the folder.
