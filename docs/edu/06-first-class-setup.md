# Create Your First Class

Now let's set up a class gallery and add students. Takes about 10 minutes.

## Step 1: Open the Admin Dashboard

1. Go to your gallery URL
2. Sign in with your school Google account
3. You should see an **Admin** link (since you're the owner)
4. Click **Admin** to open the dashboard

> **Don't see Admin?** The first person to access the gallery becomes the admin. If that wasn't you, check who opened it first.

## Step 2: Create a Class Gallery

1. Click **New Class**
2. Fill in:
   - **Class Name:** e.g., `Art 101 Fall 2025`
   - **Description:** Optional, e.g., `Introduction to Visual Arts`
3. Click **Create**

A folder for this class is automatically created in your Drive under `classes/`.

## Step 5: Test It!

   - Access their personal collection
   - Upload a test image

## You're Done with Setup!

Your gallery is ready. Students can now:
- Visit the gallery URL
- Sign in with their school accounts
- Upload artwork to their collections

---

## What's Next?

- Share the gallery URL with your students
- Read the [Teacher Guide](teacher-guide.md) for day-to-day tasks
- Give students the [Student Guide](student-guide.md)

## Something Wrong?

**"Student can't see the class"**
Make sure you added their exact school email address. Check for typos.

**"Upload failed"**
Check that the Drive folder permissions are set correctly (see [Step 3](03-create-drive-folders.md)).

**"Student sees an error"**
Have them try signing out and back in. Make sure they're using their school account, not personal Gmail.

**Congratulations!** Your art gallery is live.
