# End of Semester - Archiving Classes

What to do when a semester ends.

---

## Why Archive?

- Keeps your class list clean
- Preserves student work permanently
- Students can still view their old work on their profile
- Archived classes become read-only

---

## How to Archive a Class

1. Go to **Admin** → Select the class
2. Click **Archive Class**
3. Confirm

### What happens:
- Class moves to "Archived" section
- No new uploads allowed
- Students can still view everything
- Work stays on student profiles

---

## Starting a New Semester

1. Create a new class (e.g., `Art 101 Spring 2026`)
2. Add returning students - they'll have a fresh collection
3. Their old work remains in the archived class

> **Students keep everything.** A student's profile shows all their work across all semesters and classes.

## Un-archiving a Class

Made a mistake? You can restore an archived class:

1. Go to **Admin** → **Archived Classes**
2. Find the class
3. Click **Restore**

## Storage Notes

Archived classes still count toward your Drive storage. If you're running low on space:

1. Export artwork you want to keep
2. Ask IT about storage limits
3. Consider moving very old classes to a separate backup

In practice, this is rarely an issue - schools get lots of Drive storage.
