## Something Wrong?

**"I can't sign in"**
Make sure you're using your school Google account, not personal Gmail.

**"I don't see my class"**
Ask your teacher to add you. They need your school email address.

**"Upload failed"**
Try a smaller image (under 5MB). If it still fails, tell your teacher.

**"I accidentally deleted something"**
Unfortunately, deleted work can't be recovered. Ask your teacher if they have a backup.
